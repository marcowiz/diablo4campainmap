# diablo4campainmap
i try to create a diablo 4 map with the path the campain takes marked on it

later i said fuck that, i cant do it. 

so now that season 1 is on its way i programmed a script that listens to F1 presses and uses the existing data on xp per level to calculate how fast one is going.
